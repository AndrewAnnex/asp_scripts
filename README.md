# USGS ASP Scripts #
This Git repository consolidates a collection of Bash scripts that have been developed as part of a highly-automated workflow for generating digital terrain models (DTMs) from CTX and HiRISE stereo image data using the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP).

This repository was manually forked from the UChicago ASP Scripts project, hosted at the University of Chicago: https://psd-repo.uchicago.edu/kite-lab/uchicago_asp_scripts

Most of these Bash scripts are wrappers for the various USGS ISIS3 and ASP binaries used to generate DTMs from stereo image data. These scripts were developed to be run in a high-performance computing environment using the SLURM job manager. As such, many of the scripts contain calls to *scontrol* in order to generate a file containing a list of compute nodes for *parallel_stereo* to use. See the comments in individual Bash scripts for details on modifying them for use with another job manager (i.e. PBS) or for use on a single machine.

## Dependencies ##
- USGS ISIS3 <http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/>
- NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline <https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/>
- GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>
- GNU Parallel <https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/>
- pedr2tab <http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mgs/molasoftware.html#PEDR2TAB>
-- At USGS, we use a USGS-modified version that works on most modern flavors of Linux, and Mac OS X <https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/socet_set/blob/master/SS4HiRISE/Software/ISIS3_MACHINE/SOURCE_CODE/pedr2tab.PCLINUX.f>

## Supported Platforms ##
These scripts have been developed and tested on recent versions of Fedora, Ubuntu and Scientific Linux. They should work on other flavors of GNU/Linux either natively or in a VM.
I expect some of the scripts will fail on Mac OS X because the versions of *sed* and *awk* that ship with OS X tend to be older and have different functionality compared to their GNU cousins. A workaround would be to compile GNU versions of these programs from source or install from a package manager like MacPorts or Homebrew.

## Installation ##
Git Clone the repository to whatever system(s) you are using and ensure the ctx and hirise folders are included in your PATH.

## Usage ##
HiRISE and CTX have 3 approximately equivalent steps, with specific usages detailed in the files but detailed below:

### CTX ###
1. ctx_pipeline_part_one.sh
2. (Estimate max displacement between initial CTX DTM and MOLA PEDR using your favorite GIS software)
3. ctx_pipeline_part_two.sh

### HiRISE ###
1. hirise_pipeline_part_one.sh
2. (Estimate max displacement between initial HiRISE DTM and reference DTM, such as CTX, using your favorite GIS)
3. hirise_pipeline_part_two.sh (possibly using the final DEM.tif from the CTX step as an input)

Note that these workflows can be completed approximately in parallel, only step 3 for hirise (using `hirise_pipeline_part_two.sh`) is dependent on completing the CTX DTM if you wish to
use a paired CTX DTM for aligning the HiRISE DTM. The other thing to note is that the reference DTM used to align the HiRISE DTM should be a `DEM.tif` file, not the products from dem_geoid which end in `DEM-adj.tif`.

Due to the long run times associated with these scripts, bash traces are enabled in each file (the calls to `set -x/set +x`) to enhance logs to STDOUT.
Users are encouraged to run commands with `nohup` to save logs, ie: `nohup ctx_pipeline_part_one.sh <args> &`.
